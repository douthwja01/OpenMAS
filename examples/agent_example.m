%% EXAMPLE AGENT CLASS (agent_example.m) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This agent is intended to describe how to create a new agent class for
% simulation under the Open Multi-Agent Simulation (OpenMAS) framework. It 
% contains examples of the necessary properties and methods the class must
% have in order to interact with the environment.

% GENERAL NOTICE FOR AGENT DEFINITIONS
% - All objects(including agents) must be in '/objects' for dependancies.
% - The 'example_setup' demonstrates how the dependancies are setup.
% - All objects must have:
%   + A 'constructor' method (to create it).
%   + A 'main' method (to evaluate updates).
% - During the 'main' method, one cycle of the agents loop is computed,
%   updating the objects local state, and global properties. 

% To call the agent class, your work directory must be within '/objects',
% otherwise it must be added using 'addpath('objects')' to include the
% complete inheritance tree. 

% The class is called using the line:
% testAgent = agent_example();

% If have any questions or help getting started, please contact me directly
