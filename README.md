An open-source modelling environment for simulating multi-agent systems with complex agent decision mechanics and dynamic behaviour. 

## Overview

OpenMAS is an open-source multi-agent simulator for Matlab. This software package provides a number of tools necessary for the simulation of multi-agent systems with complex agent definitions. The software packages environment is based upon Matlab's object orientated functionality; allowing users to build and define their own agent definitions and simulate their interactions in defined scenarios.

## Where to go from here

To get started with OpenMAS:
- Check you have a compatible matlab version.
- Download the respository to your PC.
- Visit the project [Help Wiki](https://github.com/douthwja01/OpenMAS/wiki). 
- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/douthwja01/OpenMAS/wiki/Getting-Started#getting-started).
