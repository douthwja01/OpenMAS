An open-source modelling environment for simulating multi-agent systems with 
complex agent decision mechanics and dynamic behaviour. 

# Overview

OpenMAS is an open-source multi-agent simulator for Matlab. This software package provides a number of tools necessary for the simulation of multi-agent systems with complex agent definitions. The software packages environment is based upon Matlab's object orientated functionality; allowing users to build and define their own agent definitions and simulate their interactions in defined scenarios.
