% - erf         verified interval error function, also for gradient and hessian
% - erfc        verified interval complementary error function, also for gradient and hessian
% - gamma       verified interval gamma function
% - isregular   verification that an extremely ill-conditioned matrix is regular
% - ufp         unit in the first place
%
% Some new functions have been introduced so that now in debug mode a pop-up window for all 
%   INTLAB types such as intval, gradient, hessian, long, ... shows the actual values of 
%   the variables.
%
% The flip function had to be removed because some conflicts from Matlab 2013b.
%
% A demo function "dstdfcts" for higher transcendental functions is added.
